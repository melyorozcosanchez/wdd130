                <h2 class="introduction-title"> Hi, I'm Mely.</h2>
                <p class="introduction-msg"> I am a Bioengineering student and online entrepreneur. Some know me as a fellow student while others know me as their favorite online manicure trainer.
                    The reality is that I am passionate about both worlds:
                    The world of engineering studies and
                    The world of Manicure and Beauty,
                    which although quite different, I have managed to keep up with for years.
                    This has led me to create several SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES to carry out my studies and my entrepreneurship, in order to do it in less time and with order...
                    Here on my website, you will find free resources to become the STUDENT you have the potential to be.</p>

                <h2 class="helpyou-title"> How can I help you?</h2>
                <p class="helpyou-msg">Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed as engineering students with little time in our lives due to work, family or other occupations.
                    For this reason, my goal is to help you be more EFFECTIVE and EFFICIENT in your university studies, even if you have little time, by providing you with USEFUL RESOURCES to be a better student, such as: better study methods, forms of organization and time management, to study in fewer hours and be able to retain knowledge in the long term
