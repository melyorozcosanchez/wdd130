      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am going to create a website that introduce myself as a Bioengineering student and provide study methods and resources that help others engineering students, during their student life. Studying Engineering sometimes, can be a challenge for new students, so this site will teach a simple way to achieve deeper learning of the courses, practice time management and enjoining the study process at the same time. This site will have images related with the study content and some videos that will teach study methods, productive routines and advice for a better student lifestyle. Also, this web site will give to the students, a way in order to contact me, for adicional help if they need. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target customers are engineering students, who need to improve and enjoy their student life. The age of my target customers who can visit this web site is eighteen years and over and they want to learn better study methods, how to develop good habits, time management and also, relaxation techniques for their exams, in order to achieve better grades and a deep learning of the contents of courses. For that reason, they are looking for a way in order to have an enjoyable and deep learning experience, while they are in the process of study engineering in the university.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hi, I'm Mely. I am a Bioengineering student and online entrepreneur. Some know me as a fellow student while others know me as their favorite online manicure trainer.
The reality is that I am passionate about both worlds:
The world of engineering studies and
The world of Manicure and Beauty,
which although quite different, I have managed to keep up with for years.
This has led me to create several SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES to carry out my studies and my entrepreneurship, in order to do it in less time and with order...
Here on my website, you will find free resources to become the STUDENT you have the potential to be.

      </p>
      <h4>
        How can I help you?
      </h4>
    <p>Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed as engineering students with little time in our lives due to work, family or other occupations.
      For this reason, my goal is to help you be more EFFECTIVE and EFFICIENT in your university studies, even if you have little time, by providing you with USEFUL RESOURCES to be a better student, such as: better study methods, forms of organization and time management, to study in fewer hours and be able to retain knowledge in the long term

      <h3>Study Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        In my experience as a Bioengineering student and entrepreneur, I have seen the importance of learning how to organize your life as a student, so that you can not only carry out your studies in a better way, along with other occupations (work, family, etc.), but you can also enjoy the process of learning new things.
Therefore, here you will find a list of useful videos about study methods for Engineering, habits, time management, and moreâ€¦

      </p>
      <h4>Study methods</h4>
      <p>Learn powerful and useful study methods like spaced repetition, active recall, and other science-based techniques that will help you learn for the long term.
        </p>
        <h4>Habits and time management</h4>
        <p>Learn how to manage your time, by having a routine that helps you have time to study and do other things, and to develop good habits that help you organize your life as an Engineering student.
          </p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <h4>I am a Bioengineering student.</h4>
      <p> By studying a career that combines electronic engineering with medicine, I have been able to find and develop study METHODS and SYSTEMS that allow me to study fewer hours a day and more effectively, managing to retain knowledge in the long term and to be able to apply it later, in practical problems.

      </p>
      <h4>I am a self-taught student</h4>
      <p>I share and emphasize this ability to "learn on my own", in my individual consultancies as well as in my content on social networks, since I consider it vital so that SUCCESS IN YOUR STUDIES does not depend on another person, but only on you. .
        Also, as a Self-Taught person, I believe in the term: "Lifelong learning", that is, learning should be a lifestyle, including not only academic study but other experiences with people, places, etc.
        </p>
      <h4>Study and managing my online business at the same time.</h4>
      <p>I have an online manicure training business, which I run alongside my university studies.
       So, after several years of having my own business and studying at the university at the same time, I have come to adopt specific routines and systems, in my day to day, to lead a PRODUCTIVE LIFE but without so much stress, achieving a balance between being student and being an entrepreneur.
      </p>
      <h4>I am a programming student at BYU Idaho.</h4>
        <p>Currently, I am completing my first certification, entirely in English (My native language is Spanish), with the BYU-I university in its online program "Web & Computer programming", so I continue to develop the English language along with the ability to work as a team with people from other countries and languages.
