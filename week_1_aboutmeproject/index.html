    <h2>Hello everyone! You can call me Mely</h2>
    
    <p> I want to introduce myself a little bit. I'm from San Juan, Argentina and I really like to drink mate &hearts; , a special infusion from here (As you can see in my picture).
        I've been married for two years, <br> with no kids but with a cat named "Guera Kitty" that we love and consider part of our family! I served a mission in Veracruz, Mexico in 2017-2019 and it was an interesting experience where I met wonderful people.</p>
               
    <p>Something I have learned as a child in the Church of Jesus Christ (I have been a member for 22 years) and that also, we learn at BYU Idaho is that we need to pursue a life of learning both secular  <br>and spiritual things. That reminds me of the potential we have to learn what we need to learn, as children of God and that knowledge encourages me to learn many new things in my life.</p>
        
    <p>As for my work and hobbies, I discovered a new passion making videos that I didn't know I had, because I have two YouTube channels: 
    <p>&rarr;One for my work: I have an Online Academy of Manicure Courses, where I teach different things like manicure techniques and also, chemistry or physics about products and tools as well.</p> 
    <p>&rarr;And the second one: it's a hobby for me because I share my life as a Bioengineering (here in Argentina) and programming (here at BYU Pathway) student, along with study methods and useful tips for students. <br> I believe it is my way of sharing the light of the gospel to the world, as the scripture says Doctrine and Covenants 115:5: "Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations;"</p>

    <p>I believe this web programming course will help complement my study of Bioengineering in many aspects, such as giving a better look to programs or websites for health applications and for that, I am excited to do it!</p>
